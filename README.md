My JavaScript Learning Journey üöÄ
Hey everyone! Welcome to my little corner on GitHub. This is where I'm documenting my personal journey of learning JavaScript. It's a mix of practice files, notes, and a super fun project I built: an Amazon.com clone! I hope it shows how much I've learned along the way.

üìÅ What's Inside This Repo?
I've tried to keep everything organized to make sense of my learning process.

introduction/: This folder is basically my notebook! You'll find my practice code, experiments, and notes from a full JavaScript course I took. It‚Äôs where all the foundational stuff lives.

amazon-clone/: This is the highlight of my learning! It's a small but challenging project where I replicated the front-end of the Amazon website. It was a fantastic way to apply everything I learned in a single project.

‚ú® About the Amazon Clone
This project was a blast to build! I focused on making it look and feel as close to the real Amazon website as possible, using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Cool Features:

A homepage layout that's inspired by the real Amazon.

A clean design for displaying all the products.

It's responsive, so it looks great on any screen size.

All the cool interactivity is powered by my JavaScript code!

Want to check it out? It‚Äôs easy!

Go into the amazon-clone folder.

Find the index.html file.

Right-click on it and choose "Open with Live Server" (a really handy VS Code extension!).

Your browser will pop up and show you the site!

‚úÖ Putting It to the Test
I also spent time learning about testing, which was a big deal for me. I used Jasmine, a JavaScript testing framework, to write unit tests for my functions. This really helped me make sure my code was working exactly as I expected and helped me keep the quality high.

üíñ A Work in Progress
This repository is purely for my own learning and practice. It's a reflection of my growth as a developer. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to let me know‚ÄîI'm always looking to learn more!
